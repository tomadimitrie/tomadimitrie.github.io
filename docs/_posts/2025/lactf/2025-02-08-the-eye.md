The program initializes the pseudo-random engine with the current time, then shuffles the flag a few times and prints it:

The shuffle function just generates a random number and performs some swaps:

![](02.png)

Since the current time is used as a seed, we can sync our time with the server by calling `time(NULL)` as the same time. 
Then, calls to `rand()` will mirror the ones on the server.

We can test this using `libdebug`:

```py
libc = ctypes.CDLL("/usr/lib/libc.so.6")

io = debugger("./the-eye")
io.run()
io.breakpoint(0x137e)
io.breakpoint(0x13b9)
io.cont()
process_time = io.regs.rax
io.cont()
flag = io.memory[io.regs.rdi, 28].decode()
log.success(flag)
flag = list(flag)

time = libc.time(None)
assert time == process_time
```

The assert passes, so our theory is correct. Now we need to reverse the shuffling algorithm. We just need to generate all 
numbers at the beginning and, starting with the last one and going backwards, reverse the shuffling algorithm. The loop in `shuffle` goes
backwards, so we need to go forwards.

Also, since the time on the server might differ a bit, we can bruteforce the seed by offsetting it a bit. We know the flag format, so we 
know when it was successfully decrypted.

```py
import ctypes
from pwn import *
from libdebug import debugger

def shuffle(list_, rands):
    for i in range(len(list_)):
        rand = rands[i]
        list_[i], list_[rand % (i + 1)] = list_[rand % (i + 1)], list_[i]

libc = ctypes.CDLL("/usr/lib/libc.so.6")

# io = debugger("./the-eye")
# io.run()
# io.breakpoint(0x137e)
# io.breakpoint(0x13b9)
# io.cont()
# process_time = io.regs.rax
# io.cont()
# flag = io.memory[io.regs.rdi, 28].decode()
# log.success(flag)
# flag = list(flag)
#
# time = libc.time(None)
# assert time == process_time
# libc.srand(process_time)

io = remote("chall.lac.tf", 31313)
# io = process("./the-eye")
flag = io.recvline().strip().decode()
log.info(flag)
flag = list(flag)

def solve(flag, seed):
    libc.srand(seed)
    flag = flag[:]
    rands = [libc.rand() for _ in range(len(flag) * 22)][::-1]
    for i in range(22):
        shuffle(flag, rands[i * len(flag):((i + 1) * len(flag))])
    flag = "".join(flag)
    if "lactf{" in flag:
        log.success(flag)

for i in range(1000):
    solve(flag, libc.time(None) + i)
    solve(flag, libc.time(None) - i)
```
